# BattleNetClient

This is a Ruby client to communicate with the Battle.net API endpoints
release by Blizzard Entertainment.

The gem depends on `oj` and `faraday` to properly communicate with these endpoints.
A few additional dependencies have been included to make the usage of the gem easier.

The implementation of the gem is based on the [Official Blizzard Developer Documentation](https://develop.battle.net/documentation)
and requires you to understand the basics of OAuth and JSON API endpoints in order to properly
configure the required API keys to make the gem function.

## Installation

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
